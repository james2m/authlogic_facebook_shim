= authlogic_facebook_shim

This is a plugin for integrating facebook sessions into authlogic. It relies on using the Javascript SDK to
login to facebook. Currently the shim support koala (https://github.com/arsduo/koala) for access the graph API
but if you have a preferred library it is easy to add an adapter.

This requires a config/facebook.yml file that looks like this:

    development:
      app_id: appid
      api_key: apikey
      secret_key: secretkey

    production:
      app_id: appid
      api_key: apikey
      secret_key: secretkey
    
If you don't have different facebook credentials for different environments you can set these in UserSession

    facebook_app_id     'appid'
    facebook_api_key    'apikey'
    facebook_secret_key 'secretkey'
  
In your controller you probably have something like this;

    def current_user_session
      @current_user_session ||= AccountSession.find
    end

    def current_user
      @current_user ||= current_user_session.try(:user)
    end

    def logged_in?
      current_user && !current_user_session.stale?
    end

To get hold of the facebook particulars you will need to add something like this;

    def facebook_user
      current_user_session.try(:facebook_user)
    end

    def facebook_user?
      !facebook_user.nil?
    end

    def facebook_session?
      current_user_session.try(:facebook_session?)
    end

== Adapters

Currently the only adapter in the shim is for koala (https://github.com/arsduo/koala) but if you have a preferred
wrapper for accessing the graph API please fork the project and add your own adapter (with tests) then send me a pull
request.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it.  This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.  (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.  Bonus points for topic branches.
